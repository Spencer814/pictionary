Pictionary
======================

Collaborative drawing app and messenger built with socket.io and Node.js
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was built with Node, Express, Socket.io, jQuery and Bootstrap. I learned how to create a real-time web application.

The project started out as a messenger but I incorporated the colloborative canvas after I learned more about Socket.io.

*To Do*
- *add Angular*
- *toggle user control*
